## Simpl To-Do
This is the Git repository for Simpl To-Do, a single-page application that will allow authenticated users to create, read, update and delete their to-do list items.

### Planning & Problem-Solving
For this application, a signed-in user will be able to create their to-do list.

After building Simpl To-Do's API with MongoDB and Express.js, I will work on the front-end using Bootstrap, Sass, Handlebars, JavaScript and jQuery, following software design best practices and the user stories and wireframes provided below.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- Sass
- Handlebars
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Github Pages

### Unsolved Issues for Future Iterations
- ~~Test with API~~
- ~~Deploy~~
- Test deployed application
- Enhance UI
- Add extra features
  - A user will be able to create a to-do list with a maximum of three items. The idea behind this is to increase focus and productivity, based on [the rule of three](http://agilelifestyle.net/the-rule-of-3).
